# COVID19FaceMaskDetection
The accelerated spread of the COVID-19
(coronavirus) disease has put stress on healthcare systems
Some safety measures are provided, such as keeping social
distance and wearing a mask, which can help curb
transmission and save lives. This project aims to detect whether
a person is wearing a mask or not with video surveillance to
enforce health and safety regulations in real-time. Two deep learning models are proposed
, the MobileNetV2 and the Modified Convolutional
Neural Network (MCNN). The trained models are converted to
TensorFlow Lite to deploy an Android Application. The
models can achieve up to 99% accuracy. In this project, an
analysis of the number of individuals not wearing masks is
provided by capturing the face and storing it on a mobile-
backend-as-a-service. Our application can be adopted to
increase health measures in real-time and control the spread of
COVID-19.
